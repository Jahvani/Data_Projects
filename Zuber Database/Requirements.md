## Project Requirements

This project involves analyzing taxi ride data in Chicago. The key requirements are divided into two main parts: Exploratory Data Analysis and Impact of Weather on Ride Duration.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Find the number of taxi rides for each taxi company for November 15-16, 2017.
* Find the number of rides for taxi companies with "Yellow" or "Blue" in their names for November 1-7, 2017.
* Find the number of rides for "Flash Cab" and "Taxi Affiliation Services" in November 2017, and group the rides of all other companies into "Other".

### 2. Impact of Weather on Ride Duration:

* Retrieve the identifiers for the O'Hare and Loop neighborhoods.
* Categorize weather conditions from the `weather_records` table into "Bad" (rain or storm) and "Good".
* Retrieve all Saturday rides from the Loop to O'Hare, their weather conditions, and ride durations.
* Exclude rides with missing weather data.
