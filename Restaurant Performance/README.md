    * Planned visualizations: Heatmap of revenue by city, bar chart of average restaurant ratings, and scatter chart of revenue vs. food types. 
    * Outlined data preparation steps: Cleaning tables and joining `restaurant` and `orders` data in Tableau. 
2.  **Dashboard Development:**
    * Tableau was used to create visualizations. 
    * Filters were implemented for clarity.
