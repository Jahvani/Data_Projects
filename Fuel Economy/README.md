# TripleTen Code Jam Event - Fuel Economy

This project was the first initiative we completed outside of TripleTen's core curriculum, allowing us to apply our skills beyond the standard coursework.

### Fuel Economy

The project task was to evaluate the impact of drive type on fuel efficiency and emissions, compare the environmental performance of different fuel types, and analyze trends in fuel economy over time

#### The Data

The data was composed in one file, and some of the key columns were:

-   `'drive'`: Type of drivetrain (e.g., Front-Wheel Drive, Rear-Wheel Drive, All-Wheel Drive)
-   `'comb08'`: Combined MPG for gasoline vehicles
-   `'co2'`: Tailpipe COâ‚‚ emissions in grams per mile
-   `'fuelType1'`: Primary fuel type used (e.g., Regular Gasoline, Electricity, Diesel)
-   `'year'`: Model year of the vehicle
-   `'make'`, `'model'`: Make and model of the vehicle

The data was provided by TripleTen, who took it from Kaggle.

#### The Process

Our initial steps involved exploring the dataset to remove extraneous information, and then proceeding with formatting, filtering, and clarifying the column names

### Results

The presentation was livestreamed on Tripleten's YouTube channel. My team showcased our findings based on our original objectives, and after competing against another team, we were proud to have emerged as the winners of the event.
